We won't have all the zip files pre stored on the server. 

Whenever a user clicks on Download Zip, following will happen:

1.We will generate a zip file and serve to the user if its not available on our servers, and also save it to our server disk.

2. If we already have it, we will check the file generation date and time and check if any changes are made to that course after that date and time: 
	(i) If not, then serve it to user directly.
	(ii) If yes, then generate a new Zip file and serve it to user and also replace on 	our server disk.

3. If server disk is overloaded we can specify a time(say 20 days) such that if a Zip file is not downloaded for that time, it will get erased from our disk.

This way we will save both our computational power(because popular courses won't contribute to our computational load more than once since a change is made) and our server disk space (because we won't have Zip file for unpopular courses as we don't have all the pre stored files, also erasing it after an interval of time).
